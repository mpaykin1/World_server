# WORK IN PROGRESS — OPENHUMAN COLLECTIVE BRAIN PATCH V2.1

## Task
Install `OPENHUMAN_COLLECTIVE_BRAIN_PATCH_V2` then `V2.1` (repository-side pieces only) into World_server: shared-memory bridge library, coordination leases, hash-chained audit journal, capability/risk router, memory security firewall (secret redaction + prompt-injection flagging), and the `collective-brain:*` npm scripts. V2.1 additionally splits repo mutation from machine-level installation and adds a permanent "desktop-agent system-install boundary" rule to `DESKTOP_AI_INSTALL_AND_VERIFY.md` (satisfies the user's explicit ask for a standing server rule — it's now the patch's own content, not something written by hand).

## Why
User request, in two rounds: V2 first, then V2.1 (a fix targeting exactly this session's real V2 install attempt — the patch author's README literally cites "Claude correctly used an isolated worktree... then refused to download/install system software").

## Current state — V2.1, fully committed and pushed
- Isolated worktree/branch `ai/desktop/openhuman-collective-brain-v2`, based on `origin/ai/opencode/multi-ai-peer-improvement` (the shared main `World_server` checkout has hundreds of uncommitted files from other concurrent AI agents; never touched it).
- V2 installed, then V2.1 applied on top (idempotent — confirmed via a second `install.cjs`+`verify.cjs` pass). V2.1's payload code is byte-identical to V2 (`diff -rq` confirmed); only install.cjs metadata, docs, and the new `tools/*.ps1` bootstrap-split scripts changed.
- `node verify.cjs`: 18/18 bundled regression tests PASS on both the V2 and V2.1 install.
- Patch's own `verify-v2-1-handoff.cjs` self-check: PASS (confirms the old `full-install-windows.ps1` is now a hard stop — not a silent installer — post-bootstrap verifier requires the full release gate, one-click user launcher only calls the system-only script).
- Reviewed `lib/collective-brain/index.js` in full: only talks to `127.0.0.1:3111`/`127.0.0.1:11434` (loopback) by default, redacts secrets before any outbound call, refuses non-loopback plaintext bearer tokens, treats recalled memory as untrusted evidence.
- Manually ran `collective-brain-doctor.js`/`collective-brain-cycle.js` directly with no agentmemory/Ollama running: DEGRADED/DOWN but exit 0.
- Fixed a pre-existing `npm ci` lockfile drift in this worktree (`@mediapipe/tasks-vision`, `pngjs` missing from `package-lock.json` — unrelated to this patch; not committed, left for a separate fix) to get real dependencies installed for gate verification.
- **Ran the FULL `npm run release:gate` (all ~24 chained gates) — PASS.** Includes the new `collective-brain:check`/`security`/`cycle` steps alongside every pre-existing gate (procedural, desktop-ai, golden, quality:regression/fuzz/impact/perceptual/cinematic:v3, tech:audit/health, duplicates, contracts, project:review, quality:stability, evidence:score, regressions:capture, quality:issue-candidates/world, integration:verify, animation:gate, quality:ink-glyph). Zero regressions.
- Committed (2 commits: V2 install, V2.1 update), pushed to `origin/ai/desktop/openhuman-collective-brain-v2`, draft PR opened: https://github.com/mpaykin1/World_server/pull/13

## Target state
Repo-side Collective Brain merged. External runtime (agentmemory/iii/OpenHuman/Ollama, autostart, MCP config, security-tool installers) is the user's one-time action via `USER_RUN_ONCE_WINDOWS.cmd`, then this session resumes with `tools/post-bootstrap-verify-windows.ps1 -TaskWorktree C:\Users\user\Desktop\World_server_openhuman`.

## Files / systems involved
Same as V2 plus: `tools/user-bootstrap-system-only-windows.ps1`, `tools/post-bootstrap-verify-windows.ps1`, `tools/complete-openhuman-after-first-run.ps1`, `USER_RUN_ONCE_WINDOWS.cmd` (all in the patch ZIP, not copied into the repo — they're user/session tooling, not repo payload).

## Known risks
Same third-party-installer boundary as V2 (see prior entries below this file's history) — V2.1 does not change what this session will or won't install, only how the handoff is sequenced so refusing to install software never blocks repo progress.

## Golden systems that must be preserved
Confirmed via the full `release:gate` PASS this round (not just an assumption) — every pre-existing gate ran and passed alongside the new Collective Brain steps.

## Errors that must not return
Same as V2, plus three V2.1-specific protections now registered in `data/error-prevention-registry.json`: `collective-brain-dirty-main-bootstrap` (old full-install could target the dirty shared worktree), `desktop-ai-system-installer-boundary` (refusing installers must not stop repo progress), `release-gate-skipped-as-heavy` ("too heavy" is never a valid reason to skip the full gate before a merge claim).

## Tests to run
`node --test test/collective-brain.test.js` (18/18 PASS). `npm run release:gate` (PASS, full run, confirmed this round).

## Deployment / PR plan
Draft PR #13 open against `ai/opencode/multi-ai-peer-improvement`. Do not mark ready-for-review/merge until post-bootstrap runtime evidence (agentmemory health, cross-agent recall) exists.

## Current progress
Repo-side phase complete: installed, verified, full gate green, committed, pushed, draft PR live. Machine-bootstrap phase not started — waiting on the user to run `USER_RUN_ONCE_WINDOWS.cmd`.

## Next action
User runs `USER_RUN_ONCE_WINDOWS.cmd` from the V2.1 patch folder once, reports back (or just says "готово"/"done"). This session then runs `tools/post-bootstrap-verify-windows.ps1 -TaskWorktree C:\Users\user\Desktop\World_server_openhuman`, which proves agentmemory/OpenHuman runtime and re-runs the full release gate, and updates PR #13 with that evidence.

## Completion criteria
Per `DESKTOP_AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md`: real agentmemory save→recall→restart persistence, cross-agent memory proof (save from one agent, recall from a different one), OpenHuman config verification, full release gate PASS with real (not DEGRADED) agentmemory sync. Repo-side + full offline release gate are done; runtime proof is not.

## Final evidence
`node verify.cjs`: 18/18 PASS (V2 and V2.1). `verify-v2-1-handoff.cjs`: PASS. `npm run release:gate`: PASS (full chain, real exit code 0, verified without pipe-masking). PR: https://github.com/mpaykin1/World_server/pull/13 — commits `5d26fa5b`, `f010f7d0`.
